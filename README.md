# Learning-Python

All the learning based on following:
1) Python for Everybody -Exploring data using Python 3 by Dr.Charles R. Severance
2) Google search engine resources


All basics of Python you can learn in this branch.
Topics like below can be learned here:

1) variable, expression and statements
2) condition execution
3) Functions
4) Iteration
5) String (ongoing)


Keywords:
Unlike human language Python vocabulary is pretty small which is known as reserved words or keyword.
Examples:
in
for
if
elif
return
break
TRUE
FALSE
else etc.

Variables:
Later as you write programs you can make up your own word has meaning to you called variable.
Any name can be given to variables except reserved or keywords.
If you want to remember some value for ater use it should be given name, ter 'variable' in which data can be stored.
Eg:
print('Hello world') # String should be in single or double quotes.
Output: Hellow world

Compiler and Interpreter
Python is high-level language straight forward for humans to read and write and for computers read and process.
Similar examples of high-level language: Java, C++, PHP, Perl etc.
Machine level language - zero's and one's which only computer and understand.
CPU understands only machine level language and code written in one computer cannot be used in other for a machine level language.
That is the reason code is written with high-level language and moved across different computers then interpreter used and recompiling code creates machine language version.
Compiler:
A compiler transforms entire set of source code into object code or machine level and saves it as file before executing.
Interpreter:
Converts and executes source code line by line without saving it and points out errors along the way.
Python is interpreter language.
